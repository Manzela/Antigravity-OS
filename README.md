# 🪐 Antigravity OS (Core)

**The Operating System for Agentic Development.**

Turn your IDE into a Senior Engineering Team. This repository contains the "Governance Layer" that forces AI Agents to follow strict SDLC protocols (Plan -> Build -> Test -> Merge).

## Installation

Run this command in any project root:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manzela/antigravity-core/main/install.sh)"
```

## Features
- **Fail-Closed Architecture**: Agents cannot merge code without passing the Flight Recorder Protocol.
- **Flight Recorder**: A deterministic JSON state machine that prevents loops.
- **Role-Based Access**: Separates "Planner" (Architect) from "Builder" (Coder).
