# Antigravity OS (V2.2 Enterprise)

> **"High-Gravity Governance for a Weightless Developer Experience."**

**Antigravity OS** is a governance kernel that transforms your IDE into a **deterministic software factory**. It forces AI Agents to adhere to strict SDLC protocols, ensuring that generated code is planned, secure, and tested.

## Core Features

### 1. The Flight Recorder Protocol
We pass a **Flight Recorder Object**—a deterministic JSON state ledger that tracks `trace_id`, `status`, and `handover_manifest`.

### 2. The Workforce (Roles)
* **Architect (Planner)**: Generates Plans.
* **Builder (Full-Stack)**: Writes code per Contract.
* **Sentinel (SecOps)**: Enforces Security & Telemetry.

### 3. The Constitution (Rules)
* **Rule 00 (Plan First)**: No code without a Plan.
* **Rule 01 (Data Contracts)**: API Contract is Truth.
* **Rule 06 (Strict Handover)**: Validated Manifests required.
* **Rule 07 (Telemetry)**: Automated Friction Logging.
